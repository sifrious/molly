## Introduction

Laravel's events provide a simple observer pattern implementation, allowing you to subscribe and listen for various events that occur within your application. Event classes are typically stored in the `app/Events` directory, while their listeners are stored in `app/Listeners`. Don't worry if you don't see these directories in your application as they will be created for you as you generate events and listeners using Artisan console commands.

Events serve as a great way to decouple various aspects of your application, since a single event can have multiple listeners that do not depend on each other. For example, you may wish to send a Slack notification to your user each time an order has shipped. Instead of coupling your order processing code to your Slack notification code, you can raise an `App\Events\OrderShipped` event which a listener can receive and use to dispatch a Slack notification.



## Testing

When testing code that dispatches events, you may wish to instruct Laravel to not actually execute the event's listeners, since the listener's code can be tested directly and separately of the code that dispatches the corresponding event. Of course, to test the listener itself, you may instantiate a listener instance and invoke the `handle` method directly in your test.

Using the `Event` facade's `fake` method, you may prevent listeners from executing, execute the code under test, and then assert which events were dispatched by your application using the `assertDispatched`, `assertNotDispatched`, and `assertNothingDispatched` methods:

```php tab=Pest
<?php

use App\Events\OrderFailedToShip;
use App\Events\OrderShipped;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

test('orders can be shipped', function () {
    Event::fake();

    // Perform order shipping...

    // Assert that an event was dispatched...
    Event::assertDispatched(OrderShipped::class);

    // Assert an event was dispatched twice...
    Event::assertDispatched(OrderShipped::class, 2);

    // Assert an event was dispatched once...
    Event::assertDispatchedOnce(OrderShipped::class);

    // Assert an event was not dispatched...
    Event::assertNotDispatched(OrderFailedToShip::class);

    // Assert that no events were dispatched...
    Event::assertNothingDispatched();
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use App\Events\OrderFailedToShip;
use App\Events\OrderShipped;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * Test order shipping.
     */
    public function test_orders_can_be_shipped(): void
    {
        Event::fake();

        // Perform order shipping...

        // Assert that an event was dispatched...
        Event::assertDispatched(OrderShipped::class);

        // Assert an event was dispatched twice...
        Event::assertDispatched(OrderShipped::class, 2);

        // Assert an event was dispatched once...
        Event::assertDispatchedOnce(OrderShipped::class);

        // Assert an event was not dispatched...
        Event::assertNotDispatched(OrderFailedToShip::class);

        // Assert that no events were dispatched...
        Event::assertNothingDispatched();
    }
}
```

You may pass a closure to the `assertDispatched` or `assertNotDispatched` methods in order to assert that an event was dispatched that passes a given "truth test". If at least one event was dispatched that passes the given truth test then the assertion will be successful:

```php
Event::assertDispatched(function (OrderShipped $event) use ($order) {
    return $event->order->id === $order->id;
});
```

If you would simply like to assert that an event listener is listening to a given event, you may use the `assertListening` method:

```php
Event::assertListening(
    OrderShipped::class,
    SendShipmentNotification::class
);
```

> [!WARNING]
> After calling `Event::fake()`, no event listeners will be executed. So, if your tests use model factories that rely on events, such as creating a UUID during a model's `creating` event, you should call `Event::fake()` **after** using your factories.
