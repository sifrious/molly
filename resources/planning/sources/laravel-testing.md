## Introduction

Laravel is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing with [Pest](https://pestphp.com) and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) is included out of the box and a `phpunit.xml` file is already set up for your application. The framework also ships with convenient helper methods that allow you to expressively test your applications.

By default, your application's `tests` directory contains two directories: `Feature` and `Unit`. Unit tests are tests that focus on a very small, isolated portion of your code. In fact, most unit tests probably focus on a single method. Tests within your "Unit" test directory do not boot your Laravel application and therefore are unable to access your application's database or other framework services.

Feature tests may test a larger portion of your code, including how several objects interact with each other or even a full HTTP request to a JSON endpoint. **Generally, most of your tests should be feature tests. These types of tests provide the most confidence that your system as a whole is functioning as intended.**

An `ExampleTest.php` file is provided in both the `Feature` and `Unit` test directories. After installing a new Laravel application, execute the `vendor/bin/pest`, `vendor/bin/phpunit`, or `php artisan test` commands to run your tests.



## Creating Tests

To create a new test case, use the `make:test` Artisan command. By default, tests will be placed in the `tests/Feature` directory:

```shell
php artisan make:test UserTest
```

If you would like to create a test within the `tests/Unit` directory, you may use the `--unit` option when executing the `make:test` command:

```shell
php artisan make:test UserTest --unit
```

If you have a test class that mostly relies on Laravel's testing features, but a specific test method does not need the framework booted, you may apply the `#[UnitTest]` attribute to that method to skip booting the application for just that test.

```php tab=PHPUnit
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\Attributes\UnitTest;
use Tests\TestCase;

class LocationServiceTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_get_coordinates_resolves_address(): void
    {
        // This test uses Laravel's testing features...
    }

    #[UnitTest]
    public function test_get_state_returns_state_from_abbreviation(): void
    {
        // This test runs without booting the application...
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Test stubs may be customized using [stub publishing](/docs/{{version}}/artisan#stub-customization).

Once the test has been generated, you may define test as you normally would using Pest or PHPUnit. To run your tests, execute the `vendor/bin/pest`, `vendor/bin/phpunit`, or `php artisan test` command from your terminal:

```php tab=Pest
<?php

test('basic', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
```

```php tab=PHPUnit
<?php

namespace Tests\Unit;

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * A basic test example.
     */
    public function test_basic_test(): void
    {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> If you define your own `setUp` / `tearDown` methods within a test class, be sure to call the respective `parent::setUp()` / `parent::tearDown()` methods on the parent class. Typically, you should invoke `parent::setUp()` at the start of your own `setUp` method, and `parent::tearDown()` at the end of your `tearDown` method.
